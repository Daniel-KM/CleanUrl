Clean Url (plugin for Omeka)
============================


Summary
-------

This plugin for [Omeka] allows to have clean, readable and search engine
optimized URLs like http://example.com/my_collection/dc:identifier instead of
http://example.com/items/show/internal_code.

A main path can be added before collection names, as "collections" or "library":
http://example.com/main_path/my_collection/dc:identifier.

A generic and persistent url for all items can be used too, for example
http://example.com/document/dc:identifier.

Clean urls are automatically displayed in public theme.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "CleanUrl".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [Clean Url issues] page on GitHub.
